Dr Intelligent, AI Doctor

Here We Are creating an Artificial Intelligent Doctor that will use Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict
if a Person has a Heart Disease or not.

For it We will be using 'Classification' ML Algorithms to -
1. First train the ML model using 80% of data.
2. Then Test the model on 20% of unseen Test Cases to find Accuracy of model.
3. Then we will use this model to Make prediction of User Input data.
4. Based on the Input Model will generate the output 1 if the person has a disease or 0 if person doesn't have a disease.

We are using 2 Famous ML algorithms KNN: K-Nearest Neighbors & Naive Bayes for Classifying the data.

In Supervised learning, our ML Model will train on 
Labeled data of 303 patients and then will be used to make
prediction for User INPUT DATA.

User has to Input 11 Attributes into the model and then based on the learning model will
output 1/0 if he/she has a disease or not.
